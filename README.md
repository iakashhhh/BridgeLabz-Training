### Day 5 - Runtime Analysis

*(Date: 07-Jan-2026)*

- Learned `runtime analysis` and how it evaluates the efficiency of an algorithm based on time and space usage.
- Studied `Big-O notation` to express algorithm performance and scalability as input size grows.
- Understood `time complexity` analysis to measure how execution time increases with input size.
- Learned `space complexity` analysis to evaluate the amount of memory an algorithm requires.
- Studied `best`, `worst`, and `average case complexities` to analyze algorithm behavior under different conditions.
- Learned practical guidelines for optimizing Java code by reducing unnecessary computations and improving performance.
