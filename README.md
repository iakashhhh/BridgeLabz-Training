### Day 2 – Java Constructors & Access Modifiers

*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the concept of constructors in Java, their rules, and how they are used to initialize objects
- Practiced constructor overloading using default, parameterized, and copy constructors with a real-world Coffee Shop Order example
- Understood and implemented access modifiers (public, protected, default, private) and their scope of accessibility
- Differentiated between instance and class (static) variables and methods using practical examples
- Completed all assigned programs and verified outputs successfully

### Day 3 – Java Inbuilt Keywords (this, static, final, instanceof)

*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*

- Learned and understood the purpose and usage of Java inbuilt keywords: this, static, final, and instanceof
- Used the this keyword to resolve ambiguity between instance variables and constructor parameters and to support constructor chaining
- Implemented static variables and methods for shared data, utility functions, and memory-efficient class-level behavior
- Applied the final keyword to create constants, prevent reassignment, restrict method overriding, and stop class inheritance
- Used the instanceof operator for safe type-checking before casting objects in polymorphic scenarios
- Developed and verified real-world programs including Bank Account System, Library Management System, Employee Management System, and Shopping Cart System

### Day 4 – Classes, Objects & Object-Oriented Design Basics

*(Date: 30-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the difference between Classes and Objects including definition, purpose, memory allocation, syntax, and real-world relevance
- Understood class as a blueprint and object as an instance, with heap memory allocation for objects and shared structure via classes
- Implemented a Bank Account System to demonstrate object creation, method invocation, encapsulation, and unique object states
- Designed a School Management System using multiple interacting classes (Student, Teacher, Course, School)
- Explored object relationships such as association and aggregation, and how objects communicate using method calls
- Studied UML basics, including Class Diagrams (static structure) and Sequence Diagrams (dynamic interaction flow) for system design

### Day 5 – Java Inheritance & Polymorphism

*(Date: 31-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the concept of Inheritance in Java as a core OOP principle for reusing and extending existing class behavior
- Understood superclass and subclass relationships, including how child classes inherit fields and methods from parent classes
- Implemented different types of inheritance: Single, Multilevel, Hybrid and Hierarchical using real-world examples
- Practiced method overriding to achieve runtime polymorphism and modify parent class behavior in child classes
- Studied constructor chaining using super() and learned why constructors are not inherited in Java
- Explored access modifiers (public, protected, default, private) and their role in inheritance and data visibility

### Day 6 – Encapsulation, Polymorphism & OOP Scenario-Based Design

*(Date: 01-Jan-2026)*

- Learned Encapsulation to achieve data hiding and integrity using private fields with public getters/setters, implemented through a Bank Account System with proper validation
- Studied Polymorphism, including compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) to enable flexible and reusable code
- Practiced polymorphism using inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes, along with safe downcasting using instanceof
- Understood Abstract Classes vs Interfaces, their differences, use cases, and best practices for building loosely coupled and scalable systems
- Learned a structured approach to solve OOP scenario-based problems, including identifying entities, responsibilities, relationships, and behaviors
- Applied OOP design planning by defining classes, attributes, methods, constructors, access modifiers, and choosing appropriate data structures (arrays, lists, maps) based on problem requirements
- Learned Abstract Classes vs Interfaces, their features, differences, use cases, and best practices for designing scalable and loosely coupled systems
